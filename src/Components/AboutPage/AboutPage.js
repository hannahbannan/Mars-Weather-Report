        <h1>ABOUT MARS WEATHER REPORT</h1>
        <p>NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperate, wind, pressure) on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth plan near Mar’s equator. </p>
        <p>The InSight Mars lander takes measurements each sol. A sol is there Martian day. Martian days are almost the same as Earth’s days, at 24.66 hours. </p>
        <p>Temperatures on Mars are measured in degrees Celsius. Mars is generally considerably colder than Earth. However, temperatures on Mars fluctuate and sometimes it actually has mild, human-friendly weather. The highest temperature ever recorded on Mars was a balmy 86 degrees. </p>
        <p>Atmospheric pressure is measured in Pascals using an air pressure sensor. Atmospheric pressure on Mars is less than on Earth too - its atmosphere is “thinner” than Earth’s. For comparison, the average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level is around 101,325 Pascals. Mars’ atmospheric pressure is about 1% of the Earth’s pressure. </p>
        <p>The wind speed on Mars is on average calm, but Mars frequently experiences windstorms that sweep up the red dust all over its surface.</p>
