## Project Description

In this project I will create an app that displays the weather report on Mars. I want to make this look like your normal weather app, but that of another planet! I want this app to be both fun to look at and educational, so I will incorporate information on Mars' weather and seasons as well.

NASA uses their API to create a one-page weather report: https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/
I will be creating a similar but expanded application around this report.


## API

NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia, an area near Mars’ equator. This API provides the weather measurements from the last 7 sols (or days, for us Earthlings). It includes data for temperature, windspeed, and pressure.

API URL: https://api.nasa.gov/insight_weather/?api_key=NVPo1OZ86ApquiqVgY9DX61fYLbMSAO1vfNbNDwP&feedtype=json&ver=1.0

Here is a snippet of the API - atmospheric temperature (AT) on Sol 554. Shows average temp, count of measurements taken that sol, minimum, and maximum temp.

"554": {
	"AT": {
		"av": -56.99,
		"ct": 180572,
		"mn": -92.401,
		"mx": -3.97
	},
}

#### MVP 
- Fetch data from NASA API
- Render a daily weather page, 7-day report, and seasons page using the data from the API
- Write an "About" page explaining the weather information

#### PostMVP 

- Fetch data from a second weather API to compare your local weather to the Mars weather. Example: "It is 88 degrees colder in Mars today than it is in Los Angeles."
